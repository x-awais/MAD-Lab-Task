Exercises:
Problem 1:
Write a JavaScript program to list the properties of a JavaScript object. 
Sample object:
var student = {
name : "David Rayy",
sclass : "VI",
rollno : 12 };

Problem 2:
Write a JavaScript program to delete the rollno property from the following object. Also print the object before or after deleting the property. 
Sample object:
var student = {
name : "David Rayy",
sclass : "VI",
rollno : 12 };


Problem 3:
Write a JavaScript program to display the reading status (i.e. display book name, author name and reading status) of the following books. 
var library = [ 
   {
       author: 'Bill Gates',
       title: 'The Road Ahead',
       readingStatus: true
   },
   {
       author: 'Steve Jobs',
       title: 'Walter Isaacson',
       readingStatus: true
   },
   {
       author: 'Suzanne Collins',
       title:  'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games', 
       readingStatus: false
   }];

 Problem 4:
1.	Write a function called sandwich calculator. This should accept one value: bread
2.	The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches based on the amount of breads available. I need 2 breads to make one sandwich, so if there are 10 breads, it should return 5. Test your function with console.log.
3.	Extend your function so it accepts two values, bread and cheese.
4.	It takes two breads and one cheese to make a sandwich. The function should return the total number of possible sandwiches, so if there are breads, but only 1 cheese, it should return 1.
Problem 5:
1.	Write a function that accepts any number of arguments. 
2.	It calculates the average of all the number passed. It also finds the highest number from arguments passed. And returns both values as an array.
3.	Call the function and display return values on output after storing them in separate variables.
